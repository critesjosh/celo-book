## Introduction

This is a book of tutorials to help you get started with blockchain application development. It is structured in a way to make learning about blockchain development on Celo easier. 

### Who this book is for

This book is for people that want to learn how to build Celo blockchain enabled applications who already have experience with web development or are willing to put in the work to learn programming and web development concepts while reading this book.

### How to read this book

Development Basics & Context
---

Create a new token and deploy it to the network to learn about and play with many important concepts for blockchain development. First we will design a simple token contract and deploy it to Celo. As we deploy the token we will review concepts like transactions, accounts, blocks, etc.
